    <h2>What is Inspiration?</h2>
    
    <ul id="list1">
        <li>To be inspired is the process of being mentally stimulated to do or feel something, especially to do something creative.</li>
        <li>A feeling of enthusiasm you get from someone or something, which gives you new and creative ideas.</li>
        <li>The excitement of the mind or emotions to a high level of feeling or activity.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    These are all the definitions on inspiration you can find online.

        <p id="jpP">Jordan Bernt Peterson is a Canadian psychologist, author, and media commentator.
        He began to receive widespread attention in the late 2010s for his views on cultural and political issues, 
        often described as conservative. Peterson has described himself as a classic British liberal and a traditionalist.
        However, I've been following him since the past year and he gives tips on day to day life with immense detail due to
        which I find myself watching his videos almost daily. I've even read his book: 12 Rules for Life.

            recently come in the spotlight and is now the most searched person in the world. His main audience are the men that are weak and
            immasculine to which Andrew Tate has given a voice. He has said some controversial things that can be considered as misogynistic.
            He is being held in Romania, being investigated for alleged sex trafficking. Uptil now, no solid evidence have been shown to prove
            that he's guilty. Hence, I continue to listen to and be motivated by him until proven guilty. As what he says has only affected 
            me in a positive way. Wanna learn more?
