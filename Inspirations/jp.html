        One of Jordan Peterson's lines that has stuck with me. Whenever I hear the word 'Articulate', Jordan
        Peterson comes to mind. I've listened to alot of his lectures in different universities, and also podcasts he has done, such as the
        one with Joe Rogan.

        <h2>UpBringing:</h2>
        <br>
        <p style="padding-left: 10px; margin-top: -22px;">
        Peterson was born on 12 June 1962, in Edmonton, Alberta, and grew up in Fairview, a small town in the northwest of the province.
        He was the eldest of three children born to Walter and Beverley Peterson. Beverley was a librarian at the Fairview campus of 
        Grande Prairie Regional College, and Walter was a school teacher. His middle name is Bernt, after his Norwegian great-grandfather.
        Peterson grew up in a mildly Christian household. As a young man, Peterson became obsessed with the Cold War and the
        possibility of a nuclear apocalypse.

            From July 1993 to June 1998, Peterson lived in Arlington, Massachusetts, while teaching and conducting research at 
            Harvard University, where he was hired as an assistant professor in the psychology department, later becoming an associate 
            professor. During his time at Harvard, he studied aggression arising from drug and alcohol abuse.

            Beginning in 2003, Peterson appeared on television, speaking on a subject from a psychological perspective. On TVOntario,
            he appeared on Big Ideas in 2003 and 2006, and in a 13-part lecture series based on Maps of Meaning, aired in 2004. 
            In a 2007 BBC Horizon documentary, Mad but Glad, Peterson commented on the connection between pianist Nick van Bloss' Tourette
            syndrome diagnosis and his musical talent. From 2011, TVOntario's The Agenda featured Peterson as an essayist and panelist on 
            psychologically relevant cultural issues.

        <h2>Why Inspiration?</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 10px; margin-top: -15px;">
        Frankly, if you've really listened to what Jordan has to say and his ideoligies, the question why he's an inpiration wouldn't be a
        question. Unless, you're a leftist, then I understand. I mainly listen to him because he tells me what I should behave like in order to
        be succesful, in order to become a gentleman, in order to be respected, and in order to have a fulfilling day to day life. He's an 
        inpiration to many others like me and I have immense respect for him.
