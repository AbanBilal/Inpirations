    <p>I was introduced to Andrew Tate by youtube. His shorts kept showing up on my feed, those shorts were
        mainly snippets of him when he was being controversial, small clips taken from his podcasts cutting
        out the best parts. However, I'm thankful that i got introduced to his better side, which keeps me
        motivated.

    <h2>Rise to Fame:</h2>
    <p>
        In November 2008, he was ranked the 7th best light heavyweight kickboxer in Britain by the 
        International Sport Kickboxing Association (ISKA).n 2009, he gained his first championship when he
        won the British ISKA Full Contact Cruiserweight Championship in Derby and was ranked number one in 
        his division in Europe. 
        <br>
        He's been banned from main social media platforms, such as Youtube, Facebook, Twitch. He was banned 
        from twitter aswell until Elon Musk happened, bringing out free speech(the actual one).
    </p>

    <h2>Why an Inpiration?</h2>
    <p>
        For me he's really someone that I can look at and say I want to have the attributes he has.
        From his mindset to coping with mental problems and physically so good. I would definetly want to
        be like him, speaking from thw knowledge I have on him, especially because he has come to Islam as well
        and I can really call him a role model for the modern era.
